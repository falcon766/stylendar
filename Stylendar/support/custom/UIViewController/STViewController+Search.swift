 *  A simple, yet effective protocol which abstracts away some vars for a searchable view controller. It must have tha ability to cancel the ongoing requests
 *  when the following scenario occurs:
 *
 *  1. A request, let's call it A, is already ongoing for a given query string typed in the search box.
 *  2. However, the user types some new text before the last request was finished, which means he wants to see data for something else. Request B has to be started.
 *  3. Thus, let's cancel A and kickstart B to accommodate the user's needs.
 *
 *
 *  Observations:
 *
 *  1. Happens most often on low-signal internet connections.
 *  2. But not only, large datasets (eg: querying for "a") could yield this scenario.
